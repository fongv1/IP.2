# **Project:** Task Organiser
## **Author:** Vincent Fong

This project is the Individual Project from Software Academy 4.

The Task Organiser uses a text based interface to assist
a user in keeping track of a collection of tasks. The
system was built using concepts from the first two modules
of SDA 4, *Programming Foundations* and *Software Engineering*.

Where appropriate, this project took inspiration from some but 
not all elements/functions from both modules. For example, Task
Organiser was managed with an *incremental agile* approach and 
mainly used an *ArrayList* to meet its requirements.
